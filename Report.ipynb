    "Snow cover controls the global and regional climate and releases fresh water in the hydrological cycle. Snow exhibits a strong negative correlation with atmospheric temperature. Changes in snow covered areas (SCA) alter the land-surface heating and the overlying atmosphere. Therefore, trends in SCA can be a crucial indicator of how the area is being changed.\n",

    "‘The Himalaya,’ which describes India’s north extent, is the largest source of snow and ice cover outside the polar regions in the world. Several studies have indicated that the Himalayan region is warming faster than the global average over the last century. Other studies suggest that continuous increase in annual LST trends would contribute to accelerated retreating of glaciers and cause heatwave and drought conditions in lower elevations. "

    "Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south. It is the highest plateau in India with most of it being over 3,000 m. Ladakh is a high-altitude desert as the Himalayas create a rain shadow, generally denying entry to monsoon clouds. The main source of water is the winter snowfall on the mountains. "
