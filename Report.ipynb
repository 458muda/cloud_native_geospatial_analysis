    "Snow cover controls the global and regional climate and releases fresh water in the hydrological cycle. Snow exhibits a strong negative correlation with atmospheric temperature. Changes in snow covered areas (SCA) alter the land-surface heating and the overlying atmosphere. Therefore, trends in SCA can be a crucial indicator of how the area is being changed.\n",

    "‘The Himalaya,’ which describes India’s north extent, is the largest source of snow and ice cover outside the polar regions in the world. Several studies have indicated that the Himalayan region is warming faster than the global average over the last century. Other studies suggest that continuous increase in annual LST trends would contribute to accelerated retreating of glaciers and cause heatwave and drought conditions in lower elevations. "

    "Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south. It is the highest plateau in India with most of it being over 3,000 m. Ladakh is a high-altitude desert as the Himalayas create a rain shadow, generally denying entry to monsoon clouds. The main source of water is the winter snowfall on the mountains. "

    "Zonal statistics confirm that the Himalayan region is experiencing glacial retreat, particularly at lower elevations, due to global warming. This trend is evident in zone 2, where a significant decreasing trend in snow cover is noted during June and July. Additionally, zone 3 show decreasing trend in July and August. While zone 4 maintains consistent snow cover through May, June, and July, but also reveals a decline in August. These patterns are consistent with rising temperatures in the region, especially during the months of July and August, as reported in scientific literature."

    "While performing zonal statistics, there were several challenges, primarily due to errors arising from data set comparisons. The process requires that both the zones raster and the values raster not only share the same projection and spatial bounds but also the data type. In my case, zones raster, which was a result of \"xarray.apply_ufunc\" method was not dask-based and had data type as \"int64\". In practice, these rasters are both of type \"xarray.DataArray\", yet the data within differs—one being a NumPy n-dimensional array, and the other a Dask array. To resolve this, it was necessary to convert the zones raster into a Dask array format, change the data type to \"float64\" and align spatially using \"reproject_match\" and then run \"xrspatial.zonal_stats\". \n",

    "The initial plan was to employ Landsat data collection for analysis, but the complexity of managing numerous images from various Landsat satellites, such as 8, 9, and 7, for the same area, led to an overwhelming search inventory. This complexity made computations, particularly calculating the mean over time dimension, prohibitively time-consuming and costly, despite employing distributed computing with lazy evaluation. Consequently, there's a compromise between the high resolution of images and the size of the study area. In this case with large study region, using Landsat data proved impractical. Thus, researchers must choose between high-resolution data for small areas, ensuring precision, or broader analyses with lower-resolution data that offer a more general overview.\n"

    "The analysis, conducted over 13 years, could yield more pronounced trends if extended over a longer timeframe. Integrating additional datasets, such as land surface temperature and precipitation, would enhance our understanding of the relationships between these variables and their collective impact. Furthermore, utilizing higher resolution data could refine the analysis, though it may increase computational demands."
